I'm a Software Engineer living in Israel and working for RedHat.
I have a true passion for software engineering, open-source technologies, DevOps, and cloud computing. I believe in the importance of collaboration, transparency and knowledge sharing between individuals, teams, projects and organizations.
Learning as always been a big part of my life, I consider it a hobby, I love learning new technologies, expand my knowledge, and try to make our world a little better one patch at a time :).
On the education side I have a B.Sc in Software Engineering from Afeka College of Engineering in Tel Aviv Israel and a RHCSA certification from Red Hat.
